Assets
=======

Generating front end assets:

```
$ npm install
```

And then for initial compile:

```
$ npm run build
```

For production builds:

```
$ npm run build --production
```

Or, for continuous work, with 'watch' task running, just:

```
$ npm run dev
```

To generate UI toolkit pages:

```
$ npm run toolkit
```

You can also just generate CSS or JS via:
```
$ npm run styles
$ npm run scripts
```

You'll need:

* Node 8.10.0
* NPM 5.8.0

You may want to use [NVM](https://github.com/creationix/nvm) to manage Node/NPM versions.
