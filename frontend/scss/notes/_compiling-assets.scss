Compiling Assets
================

You'll need:

* Node 8.10.0
* NPM 5.8.0

You may want to use [NVM](https://github.com/creationix/nvm) to manage Node/NPM versions.

Firstly:

```
$ npm install
```

And then for initial compile:

```
$ npm run build
```

For production builds:

```
$ npm run production
```

Or, for continuous work, with 'watch' task running, just:

```
$ npm run dev
```

This will open a browser to `localhost:3000` and then use live reload. If your setup changes the development url from `aic.dev.a17.io` then update `devUrl` in `manifest.json`.

To generate these styleguide pages:

```
$ npm run toolkit
```

The style guide uses [Node Sassdown](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@antoine_a17/a17-node-sassdown).

You can also just generate CSS or JS via:

```
$ npm run styles
$ npm run scripts
```
